# Hannah Sheridan - Open-Ended Project
This program is a collection of minigames, including Pong, a Coloring Book, and Flappy Bird. The window allows the user to select minigames and switch between them.

Pong: A two-player game in which players pass a ball by bouncing it off of a bar that they control. A player receives a point if the other player does not bounce the ball back.

Coloring Book: Includes a set of colors that the user can click to change the color of their pen. The user can then click various parts of a drawing of a dog to color it in.

Flappy Bird: The user controls a "bird", jumping to avoid obstacles. If the player hits an obstacle, the game ends.
